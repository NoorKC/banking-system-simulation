# 💳 Banking System Simulation

A simple Java-based banking system that simulates account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and user interaction through a command-line interface.

## 💼 Features

- Create new accounts
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- View account details
- Store and retrieve data using `bank.txt`

## 🧱 File Overview

- `Main.java`: Entry point of the program
- `Account.java`: Represents customer account data
- `Collection.java`: Manages all accounts
- `Interface.java`: Handles user input/output
- `bank.txt`: Stores persistent banking data

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in your Java IDE
2. Run `Main.java`
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the system

## 🔐 Note

This is a beginner-friendly simulation designed for academic practice — not for real banking use (unless you're planning to start EkBank™, in which case call me 😎)
